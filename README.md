karma-mocha-chai
================

Skeleton setup for a bare project using karma with mocha and chai.

## Getting started
1. clone the repository
   * *Note*: if you want to use this to kickstart a new project, you can use
   svn to export the repository without inheriting the history of this project:
     * `svn export https://github.com/zpratt/karma-mocha-chai`
2. npm install
3. npm test

After running `npm test` you should see a failing test.

## Changelog
* **07/14/14**
  * Updated to use 0.12.x version of karma
  * Added a grunt configuration
